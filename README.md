# Chat_translator

Requires translate-server to be running. Runs on port 3000 by default.

Usage:

CTRL + ALT + `  while text on page highlighted will translate it to english.
Double click on page text item. This will add a translation beside it.
CTRL + ALT + G for a popup window where you can select a language to translate to.
While in text chat input box. Type in CTRL + ALT + ` will replace text with a 
translation into language selected in CTRL + ALT+ G popup window

At the moment there is no way to translate received text or highlighted text 
messages to anything other than english. This was intentional.
